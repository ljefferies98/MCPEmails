// Every writer goes through the constant
//
// This check had three holes, all of which let a hardcoded sentinel back in
// with the suite green, and all three are closed here.
//
//  1. The negative check was /card_build_notified:\s*['"`]/, which a writer
//     spelled `['card_build_notified']: 'stale'` — or with a space before the
//     colon — walks straight past. So the negative check now looks for a quoted
//     literal equal to the SENTINEL VALUE anywhere in the file, whatever the
//     property is spelled like, and it runs on the RAW source so no amount of
//     comment-stripping can hide one.
//  2. The positive check was `source.includes(...)` against the raw file, which
//     a COMMENT satisfies: delete the real write, leave a comment mentioning
//     it, green. So the positive check runs on the source with comments and
//     only comments removed.
//  3. Coverage was two hardcoded route paths, so a third writer added later was
//     simply not checked. Writers are now DISCOVERED by walking the source.
//
// The DISCOVERY was the real problem, and it was attacked five times. Every
// round it was a hand-maintained list of top-level roots, and every round a
// verifier found a tree that was not on it — `.jsx` under apps/web; then
// apps/web itself rather than app/ + src/; then the whole edge-function
// RUNTIME; then the other four edge functions plus packages/, scripts/,
// tools/, self-host/ and apps/mcp-app. The fifth round found six more, all
// reproduced GREEN on 2026-09-17 against the round-4 checker (1164 passed / 0
// failed here and 8/8 in the Node mirror, identical to the clean-tree control,
// with each probe live in the tree):
//
//   * `docs/` was not a root, and it is a live source tree —
//     docs/token-cost/measure.mjs is 213 lines of executable Node with a
//     shebang;
//   * the repo ROOT was not a root, so `./probe.ts` passed;
//   * `.sql` lived outside SQL_ROOTS in three places: supabase/tests/ (4 live
//     files), supabase/verify_rls_production.sql sitting directly beside
//     functions/ and migrations/, and docs/usage-based-pricing/*.sql;
//   * a symlinked DIRECTORY inside a walked root was invisible, because
//     `Dirent.isDirectory()` and Deno's `DirEntry.isDirectory` are both lstat
//     semantics: such an entry is neither recursed into nor extension-matched,
//     so it fell through both branches silently;
//   * `packages/mcpemails/fixtures.test.helper.ts` was skipped by the
//     `!/\.test\./` filter — precisely the fixture-a-refactor-promotes-to-real-
//     code case, and the name never has to change;
//   * out/ and build/ are gitignored but were NOT skipped (only node_modules
//     and dot-prefixed names were), so a bundle emitted there could be read and
//     FALSE-FAIL on a bundled 'stale'.
//   * and one the fifth round did not name: the walk skipped every entry whose
//     NAME starts with a dot, which excluded apps/web/app/.well-known/ — SEVEN
//     live Next.js route handlers, four of them the OAuth metadata routes. A
//     writer planted there passed 1164/0 and 8/8 on 2026-09-17. That skip is
//     also exactly how the 623-file figure reconciles: 623 tracked source files
//     sit under the old roots once .test.-named files and dot-prefixed paths are
//     removed, and the new list is 759.
//
// So the root list is gone, and nothing replaces it. The file list is
// `git ls-files --cached --others --exclude-standard`, which IS the repo:
// every tracked file, plus every untracked file the repo does not ignore. That
// closes all six at once and permanently. node_modules/, .next/, out/, build/
// and .claude/ are excluded by the repo's own .gitignore instead of by a second
// hand-maintained list; git does not descend a symlinked directory, so a
// symlink's target is enumerated at its real path or not at all; and a new
// top-level directory is covered the day it is committed, by someone who has
// never heard of this file. `--others` keeps the property the filesystem walk
// had, that an uncommitted writer is still caught.
//
// The `.test.` skip went with it: a filename-shaped skip is the same mistake one
// level down. Every source file is read now, and the four files ALLOWED to
// contain a bare sentinel literal are listed by path in SENTINEL_EXEMPT — the
// two modules that declare the constant, and these two drift checks, which
// quote every evasion they pin.
//
// SQL is checked too, because the sentinel IS a database value and a migration
// or PL/pgSQL function is a plausible writer no TypeScript walk can see. That
// check used to be shape-matching — `set card_build_notified = '…'` and a DDL
// `default '…'`, over a source with SQL comments stripped — and it was defeated
// in its own home directory: one planted migration under supabase/migrations/
// carried three real writes and passed both suites. Ten assignment shapes
// passed in all: `$$stale$$` and `$tag$stale$tag$`, `INSERT … VALUES`,
// `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE SET … = excluded.…`, a PL/pgSQL `:=` through a
// variable, a trigger's `NEW.col :=`, MIXED CASE (unquoted SQL identifiers are
// case-insensitive; the `includes()` early return was not, so such a file was
// never even considered), `CASE WHEN … THEN 'stale'`,
// `EXECUTE format('… = %L', 'stale')`, and `concat('sta','le')` / `chr(115)||…`.
//
// The comment stripper was broken in both directions on top of that. False
// pass: a `--` inside a string literal ate the rest of the line, write included
// (`set note = 'a -- b', card_build_notified = 'stale'`). False FAILURE, twice,
// which defeats the stripper's own stated purpose of not tripping over
// `comment on column`: documenting the forbidden shape in the column comment
// turned the suite RED, both as `… is 'do not write: set card_build_notified =
// ''stale'''` and as `… is 'never give this column a default ''stale'''`. And
// PostgreSQL NESTS block comments while `/\/\*[\s\S]*?\*\//` stops at the first
// `*/`, so `/* outer /* inner */ update … 'stale'; */` — entirely a comment to
// PostgreSQL — was a third false failure, not the false pass it looks like.
//
// Every fix for those is a step toward a SQL parser, which is how this checker's
// TypeScript half acquired its own documented-not-closed evasions. So the rule
// is blunt and the stripper is DELETED: no `.sql` file may NAME
// `card_build_notified` at all, case-insensitively, except the two migrations in
// SQL_ALLOWED. There is no shape to evade, because nothing but the identifier is
// matched. The value does not enter into it, which also catches a migration
// writing this column some value OTHER than the sentinel — the same drift, and
// invisible to any quoted-'stale' rule. The one false-failure mode is a
// migration that genuinely has to touch the column, and the fix is a one-line
// SQL_ALLOWED edit with a reason beside it.
//
// Two evasions are still DOCUMENTED rather than closed on the TypeScript side,
// because closing them means parsing rather than matching: a column name
// assembled from fragments (`['card_build' + '_notified']`) is invisible to a
// check keyed on the literal column name, and a sentinel value assembled from
// fragments (`'sta' + 'le'`) is invisible to the quoted-literal check. Both look
// deliberate enough that a reviewer would stop them, which is not true of a
// `.jsx` file. The SQL rule above has no such gap, because it matches the
// identifier and nothing else.
//
// The checker is pinned against synthetic evasions below: a check asserted only
// against files that already pass proves nothing about what it rejects.
//
// The twin of all of this lives in apps/web/src/lib/mcp/card-listing.test.ts —
// duplicated for the same reason the constant is, since the two runtimes cannot
// import from one another.

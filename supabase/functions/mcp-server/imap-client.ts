/**
 * imap-client.ts — minimal IMAP client for the MCP edge function (Deno).
 *
 * Serves IMAP inboxes (iCloud, Yahoo, Zoho, Yandex, and the generic connector)
 * that have no JMAP/REST API. Uses Deno.connectTls for implicit-TLS IMAP
 * (port 993) and the stored app password: SASL PLAIN by default, the LOGIN
 * command or CRAM-MD5 when the server's advertised mechanisms rule PLAIN out
 * (see imap-auth.ts).
 *
 * Scope (Phase 1): connect → authenticate → SELECT → UID SEARCH → UID FETCH
 * (ENVELOPE + FLAGS + BODYSTRUCTURE) → LOGOUT. This is enough for list_inbox;
 * email_read/search/send build on the same connection primitives.
 *
 * Auth failures throw ImapAuthError so callers can surface a reconnect prompt.
 * Oversized messages throw ImapMessageTooLargeError rather than being buffered,
 * because this runs in a 256MB Deno isolate that is shared with other tenants'
 * in-flight requests: one unbounded allocation kills the whole worker, not just
 * the request that caused it. See MAX_SHARED_BUFFER_BYTES and
 * DEFAULT_MAX_LITERAL_BYTES below for the two ceilings that enforce this.
 * A faithful Node reference lives at apps/web/src/lib/email/imap.ts.

   * {n}CRLF<octets>"), and strict servers enforce it: Yahoo answered
   * "[BADCHARSET] UID SEARCH Unsupported text encoding" (production, Yahoo
   * IMAP, 2026-09-01T06:36:39Z) and ex4.mail.ovh.net answers "Command Error.
   * 11". Our user base is heavily Norwegian and European, so an accented search
   * term is an ordinary request, not an edge case.
   *
   * The pure-ASCII case is deliberately untouched, byte for byte and round trip
   * for round trip: it is essentially all live traffic, and this method is on
   * the path of every list, search, contact scan and draft lookup in the
   * product. Non-ASCII is detected first and is the ONLY thing that takes the
   * new, chattier path.
   *
   * DESIGN NOTE, why the split happens here and not in `toImapSearch`: a
   * criteria string reaches this method from several places, and only one of
   * them comes out of `toImapSearch`. index.ts also hand-builds
   * `HEADER Message-ID "<...>"` and the contact scanner's
   * `OR OR FROM "Q" TO "Q" CC "Q"`, where Q is a user-supplied name that is
   * every bit as likely to be "Bjorn" spelled properly. Returning a structured
   * operand list from `toImapSearch` would have fixed exactly one of those call
   * sites and left the others encoding raw octets. Parsing the assembled
   * criteria here fixes all of them at once, keeps `toImapSearch` a pure string
   * translator with its existing tests intact, and confines the change to this

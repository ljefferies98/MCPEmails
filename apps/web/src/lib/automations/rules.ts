/**
 * Automations (internal prefix `triage_`): shared server-side validation.
 *
 * Everything a client sends is re-validated here. The dashboard form is a
 * convenience, not a boundary: an automation runs unattended, repeatedly, with
 * no human in the loop, so an unchecked field would silently become a standing
 * instruction against a real mailbox.
 *
 * Three rules are load-bearing and must not be relaxed:
 *
 *   1. There is NO delete-shaped action. Not trash, not permanent, not
 *      "archive then purge". `assertNoDeleteShape` rejects anything that even
 *      names deletion so a future action type cannot slip one in by accident.
 *   2. `forward` is always approval-gated downstream. This module still caps
 *      the recipient list so a rule cannot fan out to an unbounded audience.
 *   3. `draft_reply` produces a draft. The template is stored verbatim and is
 *      never evaluated; only the placeholder whitelist below is substituted.

// server-side fix derives its list from the translator CLAUSES for that reason.
// search-translate.ts is pure, dependency-free TypeScript with no imports of
// its own, and the Vercel project has `sourceFilesOutsideRootDirectory: true`
// (checked 2026-09-21 against the project API), so the Next build resolves it
// from the repo tree even though the Root Directory is apps/web.
//
// Contrast src/lib/email/utf7.ts, which IS a copy and explains at length why.
// That direction is the impossible one: the codec has to run inside the Deno
// bundle too, and an edge function deployed with `supabase functions deploy`
// can import nothing from outside supabase/functions/. This import only runs
// web -> edge, so it has no such problem.

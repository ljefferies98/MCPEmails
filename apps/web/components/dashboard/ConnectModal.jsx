/**
 * The props that tell a browser and a password manager that this is NOT a

 *
 * It looked exactly like one: a real `<form>` on the same origin as /login,
 * with `autoComplete="email"` on the address and `autoComplete="current-password"`
 * on the secret. Chrome, Safari and 1Password all read that pair as "sign in to
 * this site" and offer the saved mcpemails.com password. A user who accepts it
 * has just sent their account password to their MAIL provider, and that is not
 * a hypothetical failure mode: it is `account_password_used`, the largest
 * classified sub-case of auth_failed (see lib/email/auth-failure.ts), and the
 * one the shape rule in this file exists to catch after the fact.
 *
 * The code already knew this was dangerous. The reconnect path locks its fields
 * for exactly this reason, with a comment saying so, and it was fixing the
 * narrower half of the problem: a locked field cannot be autofilled, but every
 * FIRST connection was still being offered the wrong credential.
 *
 * STEERING, NOT SILENCE. Two things, and deliberately not the four this
 * started with:
 *  - `autoComplete="off"`, which Chrome honours on a field it has not already
 *    decided is a login field;
 *  - a `name` that does not read as one, which is the signal the heuristics
 *    fall back on when the attribute is ignored ("password", "email" and
 *    "username" are the names that trip them).
 *
 * It also carried `data-1p-ignore`, `data-lpignore` and `data-form-type="other"`,
 * the documented per-manager opt-outs for 1Password, LastPass and Dashlane.
 * Those are a different instrument. The two above say "this is not the login
 * for mcpemails.com"; those three say "offer nothing here at all", and the
 * thing they stopped offering was the credential the user actually needed. A
 * Gmail, iCloud, Yahoo or AOL app password is sixteen random characters that
 * nobody holds in their head. It lives in the same manager, and for one day it
 * could not be filled from it.
 *
 * That day is measurable. Of the workspaces that began a connection, 90.4%
 * (103/114) reached a connected mailbox in the week before this shipped and
 * 68.8% (11/16) in the day after. The gap survives standardising for which
 * providers people chose (Mantel-Haenszel z = -2.27, p = 0.023), and it is the
 * same size on the branded cards as on the generic form, which is what rules
 * out the autodiscovery that landed in the same commit and points here: this
 * object is on `cm-password`, and `cm-password` is every path. 19 of the 29
 * failures were `auth_failed` at the authentication phase, which is what not
 * being able to produce a credential looks like from the server.
 *
 * The original diagnosis was right and is kept. `account_password_used` is a
 * real failure and this form did invite it. But the cure has to leave the user
 * able to reach their own mail password, so it steers the heuristics instead of
 * shutting the manager off.
 *
 * The reveal toggle and the select-on-focus-after-rejection behaviour are

            The wrap used to be an inline style applied ONLY to the paywall
            panel with the annual interval chosen, on the reading that the
            annual CTA's price label was the thing that did not fit. That was
            measured in English. In Norwegian the MONTHLY row needs about 480px
            ("Avbryt" + "Sammenlign alle planer" + "Oppgrader til Personal,
            $5/md"), the modal is about 360px wide at a 375px viewport, .btn and
            both anchors are white-space: nowrap and .modal is overflow: hidden,
            so Cancel was clipped through the left edge of the dialog at the
            product's single revenue moment, with no way back to it.

            It is a class now (.modal-foot-limit, plus an unconditional wrap
            under 480px for every modal footer) and it is unconditional: with
            justify-content flex-end a row that fits still renders on one line,
            so wrapping costs the wide case nothing. */}

              interval chosen in the panel above and monthly until someone
              chooses otherwise. /api/stripe/checkout/start creates the session
              server side and redirects to Stripe, so this is one click from
              blocked to card form with no dashboard render in between. It must
              stay a plain anchor: a next/link prefetch would open checkout
              sessions for people who never clicked.

              Personal, not Pro: the cap this panel answers is the Free plan's
              single inbox, and the cheapest plan that clears it is Personal at
              $5. Sending someone to Pro to add a second mailbox prices the
              upgrade well above the problem. Anyone who genuinely needs
              unlimited mailboxes finds Pro through "Compare all plans", which
              stays as the secondary link.

              That is the CONSUMER case. A workspace that already holds a
              mailbox on a company domain is shown Personal and Pro side by
              side in the body instead (see inboxCapOffer), because for that
              buyer "Compare all plans" was the only road to the plan they
              needed and most of them never took it.

              Only a capped account ever sees this panel, and the grandfathered
              cohort has no cap, so nobody who already holds unlimited inboxes
              can be routed at Personal from here. */}
